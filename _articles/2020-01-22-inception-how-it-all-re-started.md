**Disclaimer: It's been more than 10 years since my last blog entry.**

In quite some time now, I feel like I'm able to fit writing blog posts back into my daily routine to share my takes on what I enjoy doing most: developing (good!) software. üë®‚Äçüíª

A Lot of things happened around here these years. Back in 2010, I started a business that professionally speaking has been a huge catalyst for my career, turning my strongest passion into what I now do for a living.  Going on, I had the opportunity to join one of the very first Italian agile development teams and companies where I still work today nearly 7 years later.

**Now feels just the right moment to start sharing what I've learned so far and what the actual roadmap looks like in the other direction!**

I have many project ideas that I am willing to disclose and to develop in the near feature. I'll be posting honest progress and insights on those ideas to explore any kind of feedback as well as give you a sneak peek into what I am doing every day.

## Let's talk about the blog
I wanted a fresh start, that's why I decided to go from scratch instead of resuming the one I already had. I'm sure nobody will mind that too much!


To keep it basic it had to be something I don't have to pay nor care for too much. Ever. I ended up using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) which notoriously works well with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Though since that kind of choice felt somewhat outdated nowadays, I wanted to give [@11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) (Eleventy) a try and it turned out to be really great! and fast!

I will definitely write some articles about setting up and extending an Eleventy website while growing this blog and I'll try my best to "module up" some features I'm thinking of to help Eleventy's awesome community out!

## TL;DR
This blog is made with ‚ù§Ô∏è using [@11ty](https://www.11ty.dev). I will be writing about software development, real-life stories, project ideas, events, cryptocurrencies, products I'm about to launch and generally give you a sneak peek at what I'll be doing.

## Stay tuned!

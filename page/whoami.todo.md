The thing is, I found out I love writing and looking at the bigger picture of product and strategy. I joined the world of consulting and entrepreneurship when WebRTC was announced.

For the last 20 years, I’ve been working in the software communications space as an engineer, manager, marketer and CTO; changing my viewpoints so I won’t get bored.

Today I help companies simplify communication technologies, creating elegant and effective solutions. I also serve as Co-founder and CEO of testRTC, a company focusing on testing and monitoring WebRTC applications.

I have been building things on the web professionally for almost 20 years. Between 2009 and 2018 that happened at agencies where I was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients.

After 9 years working at agencies, I returned to working on a product. Now as part of the Developer Experience team at Netlify my focus is on developing strategies for using JAMstack technologies to make building for the web simpler, faster and more secure.

# Inception: How it all (re)started!

**It's been more than 10 years since my last blog entry.** In quite some time now I feel like I'm able to fit writing blog posts back into my daily routine to share my takes on what I enjoy doing most: developing (good!) software. üë®‚Äçüíª

A Lot of things happened around here these years. Back in 2010, I started a business, which professionally speaking has been a huge catalyst for my career, turning one of my greatest passions into what I now do for a living.

Later in 2013, I had the opportunity to join one of the most reputable Italian agile development teams and companies where I still work as of today nearly 7 years later.

It feels just the right moment now to start sharing what I've learned during this journey if anything else. ‚úçÔ∏è I have many project ideas i will develop in the near future, and this time around i'd like to take the opportunity to both share and keep track of them, using this blog as a creative outlet. getting used and hopefully better with every blog post i write.

# Though let's keep it basic
Since i wanted a fresh start, I decided to start the entire blog over again.

Since the last time I went the Wordpress way and lost myself in dealing with all the tecnicalities, instead of spending exactly that time in writing articles. this once, i decided to flip the process around.

I'll start as simple as just writing the text using typora and eleventy.
This will make this blog blazing fast no matter what. :rocket:

Everything else will eventually follow, according to what's best!


# What's next?
Long story short... I will write about software development, real life stories, project ideas, events, products i'm about to launch, cryptocurrencies and whatever else i will do on a daily.

**Stay tuned!**
